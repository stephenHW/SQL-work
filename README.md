# Project Name

Here is an example of various SQL scrips that contain commands that I wrote in the IBM DB2 cloud database. These scripts accessed both manually inputted data tables (For Example: PETRESCUE_CREATE.sql) and tables that were uploaded to the IBM DB2 server via CSV file. I will include all CSV files used in a seperate folder.
